      <h2>The Inventor</h2><br><br><p>James Naismith, a physical education instructor at the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, gets the credit for inventing basketball in 1891.</p><br><br><br>

      <h2>The Need</h2><br><br><p>Naismith was looking for an indoor game to keep athletes active during the harsh winters. He wanted something less rough than football but still fun and competitive.</p><br><br><br>
      
      <h2>The Birth of a Game</h2><br><br><p>Naismith came up with the original rules, including using peach baskets (hence the name "basket"ball) and throwing a ball through them for points. There were 13 rules in total.</p><br><br><br>
      
      <h2>The Spread</h2><br><br><p>The YMCA network played a big role in popularizing basketball across the United States. The fast-paced, team-oriented sport quickly gained traction.</p><br><br><br>
      
      <h2>Naismith's Legacy</h2><br><br><p>Beyond inventing the game, Naismith also founded the University of Kansas basketball program in 1898. He lived to see basketball become an Olympic sport in 1936.</p></div><br><br><br>
